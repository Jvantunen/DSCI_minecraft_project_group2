    "In order to address my question I will use predictive/classification models. I will begin by visualizing if there is a linear relationship between the predictive variables (experience and played_hours) and the response variable (suscribe). If there is a linear relationship I will then use linear regression to proceed with my prediction model. This method is appropriate as I am asking a predictive question where I am looking to see how a predictive variable is related to the response variable. A potential limitation to this model is that my variables are of different types and therefore using both played_hours and experience will be more challenging. It will not be possible to my knowledge to use a scatter plot to see if experience and suscribe have a linear relationship, but we can visualize it in bar graph to see if there is any relationship. Additionally, analysis of the  specificity and sensitivity may be challenging for me to interpret as I am not well versed in this genre of data. In order to train the model I will split the data into a 65/35 split and then use a 5 fold cross validation in order to optimize the selection of K. "
